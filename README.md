# Studentforminformation

This project contains a simple HTML form for student registration. The form collects contact information, personal details, and preferred job information.

## Features
- Responsive and clean design using CSS
- Collects name, contact, email, age, gender, addresses, date of birth, password, job preferences, salary, experience, skills, and education
- No JavaScript required
- Ready to deploy as a static site (e.g., Vercel, GitHub Pages)

## Usage
1. Open `form.html` in any web browser to view and use the form.
2. To deploy online, rename `form.html` to `index.html` and upload to a static hosting service like Vercel or GitHub Pages.

## Deployment on Vercel
1. Push this project to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and import your repository.
3. Vercel will automatically deploy your site and provide a live URL.

## Note
- The form's `action` is set to `/submit`, which requires a backend to process submissions. For static hosting, submissions will not be saved unless you set up a backend.

This project is open source and free to use.
